    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Let me break that calculation down for our listeners real quick. So we multiply 0.999 by $1 for the likely outcome, getting about $1, then multiply 0.001 by -$10,000 for the rare event, getting -$10. Add these together and... yeah, -$9 expected value per play. Is this why you emphasized process over outcomes earlier?"
    },
