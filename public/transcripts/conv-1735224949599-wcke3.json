      "text": "Yeah, absolutely"
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",

      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Uh-huh."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Then there's unsupervised learning, where the AI kind of... figures out patterns in data on its own."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "And then there's reinforcement learning, which is really interesting because it's more like... well, like how we learn to ride a bicycle - through trial and error."

    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Let me see if I can work through this..."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "So with supervised learning, it's almost like having a teacher who shows you the correct answer for each example?"
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",

      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "You know, the concept of artificial neurons really intrigues me."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Would I be right in thinking that each neuron takes multiple inputs, weighs them differently, and then... sort of decides whether to 'fire' or activate based on those weighted inputs?"
