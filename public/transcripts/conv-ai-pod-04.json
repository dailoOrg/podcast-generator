      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Absolutely, Jane. In today’s digital age, Machine Learning, or ML as it’s often referred to… it’s becoming increasingly relevant. It’s a subset of artificial intelligence… AI… and it’s changing the way we live and work."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "That’s so right, Alex. But before we dive in, let’s start with the basics. So, Alex, how would you… how would you define Machine Learning?"
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Wow… great question, Jane. Now, at its core, Machine Learning is a method of data analysis… it automates analytical model building. It’s a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea… the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions… with minimal human intervention."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "And this technology, it’s everywhere! Whether it’s Netflix recommending what to watch next, your phone recognizing your face… or even email spam filters, it’s everywhere!"

    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "[Laughs] Indeed, no terminator scenarios here! Now, let’s dive a bit deeper. There are different types of Machine Learning, aren’t there?"
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Yes… Yes, there are mainly three types - Supervised Learning, where the model is trained on a labeled dataset… Unsupervised Learning, where the model learns from an unlabeled dataset… and Reinforcement Learning, where an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results."

    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Spot on, Jane. Algorithms are the backbone of Machine Learning. They’re the rules… the rules or instructions followed to solve problems and make predictions or decisions."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Now, let’s talk about the impact of Machine Learning. It’s been quite transformative across industries, hasn’t it?"
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Indeed, Jane. From healthcare to finance, Machine Learning is revolutionizing how businesses operate, making processes more efficient… more accurate."

    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Looking ahead… I think we’ll see more personalized experiences, thanks to Machine Learning. But we’ll also need to address challenges like data bias and security."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
      "text": "Absolutely, Jane. As this technology evolves, we must also focus on improving its interpretability and fairness."
