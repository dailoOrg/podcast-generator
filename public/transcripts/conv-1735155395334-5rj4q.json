    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "And then there's reinforcement learning, which is really interesting because it's more like... well, like how we learn to ride a bicycle - through trial and error."

      "text": "Let me see if I can work through this..."

      "speakerId": "speaker-1",

      "speakerId": "speaker-1",
