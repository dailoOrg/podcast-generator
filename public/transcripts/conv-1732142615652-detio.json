I'm really excited about today's guest - we have Dr. Jane Thompson with us, who's spent, what, two decades now pushing the boundaries of AI? Jane, I've been thinking about this a lot lately... what if computers could actually learn like we do?"

      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "(thoughtful pause) Hmm, you know, that's exactly the question that sparked the whole machine learning revolution, Alex. It's fascinating, really... (engaging tone) In essence, machine learning is about teaching computers to learn from experience rather than following strict programming rules. You know how a child learns to recognize cats, right? They don't sit there memorizing a list of features - they just learn naturally through seeing lots of examples."
    },
    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-1",

      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "Yeah, absolutely! Let's take something we all know - facial recognition. (enthusiastic) So, in traditional programming, right, we'd have to literally write out rules like \"if there are two eyes, a nose below them, and a mouth below that, then it's a face.\" But with machine learning... (brief pause for emphasis) it's completely different."

    {
      "speakerId": "speaker-2",

      "speakerId": "speaker-2",
      "text": "(enthusiastic) Oh, absolutely! Let's look at healthcare - it's a perfect example. So, in supervised learning...
